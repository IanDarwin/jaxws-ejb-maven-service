= EJB+JAX-WS Maven Demo - Service

Demo of a simple EJB+SOAP service built using the Maven JAX-WS plugin.

Configuration is for JBoss Wildfly by default.
Note that the combined bean doesn't deploy on WildFly 8 or earlier.
For servers using Metro implementation of JAX-WS, edit web.xml
and comment out wildfly part, uncomment Metro part.

There is no client code for either service mode at the moment.
Please feel free to create one and submit it!

== Usage

----
mvn clean compile jaxws:wsgen package 
mvn wildfly:deploy
----

On servers other than WildFly, omit the `wildfly:deploy` and deploy the artifact from `jaxws-maven-service-1._n.n_-SNAPSHOT.war` into another EE server.
