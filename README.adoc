= JAX-WS Maven Demo - Service

Demo of a simple service built using the Maven JAX-WS plugin.

Configuration is for JBoss Wildfly by default.
For servers using Metro implementation of JAX-WS, edit web.xml
and comment out wildfly part, uncomment Metro part.

== Usage

----
mvn clean compile jaxws:wsgen package 
mvn wildfly:deploy

On servers other than WildFly, omit the `wildfly:deploy` and deploy the artifact from `jaxws-maven-service-1._n.n_-SNAPSHOT.war` into another EE server.
